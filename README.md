# Twilio
*************************************************************************************************************************************************

So we've all used our phones to send out text messages. But sometimes there is a need for code to send texts. Consider the following.

* Taxi companies send out text messages to their passengers informing them of the cab driver's location.
* Dating websites help potential couples communicate with each other while using texts, but without sharing phone numbers.
* To make authentication more secure Gmail sends its users a security code via text message. This the Gmail user can then use in addition to their password.
* Retail organizations communicate daily deals to their customers, while using texts.

Now our goal is to send a text message using code, and I know of a Python packagethat does exactly that. It's called twilio

What is class?

A class is a blueprint or factory that describe the nature of something.Also defines the characteristics of a thing (attributes).

A particular Instance of a class is called OBJECT(ex:DOG).
