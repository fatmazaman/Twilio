# Twilio
*************************************************************************************************************************************************

So we've all used our phones to send out text messages. But sometimes there is a need for code to send texts. Consider the following. 

* Taxi companies send out text messages to their passengers informing them of the cab driver's location. 
* Dating websites help potential couples communicate with each other while using texts, but without sharing phone numbers.
* To make authentication more secure Gmail sends its users a security code via text message. This the Gmail user can then use in addition to their password. 
* Retail organizations communicate daily deals to their customers, while using texts.
